# ImageTessellator
Couple of python macros in a script that allows a user to tessellate an image (cut into continuous tiles) and/or take a set of image tiles and reconstruct them into an image. </br>

See the example image (below , TileNumberingExampleFor2Rows4Columns.jpg) for how the numbering works and how you should number your images if you want to use the untessellator to stich your tiles together </br>
