# ImageTessellator
Couple of python macros in a script that allows a user to tessellate an image (cut into continuous tiles) and/or take a set of image tiles and reconstruct them into an image. <\br>

See the example image for how the numbering works and how you should number your images if you want to use the untessellator to stich your tiles together <\br>
